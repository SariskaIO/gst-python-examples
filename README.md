# gst-python-examples

This repository contains examples of GStreamer pipelines written in Python.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and GStreamer installed on your system. If you're using Ubuntu, you can install them with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-gst-1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
```

# Running the examples

The examples are located in the examples folder.

To run an example, navigate to the examples directory in your terminal and run the Python script with Python. For example, if you want to run example1.py, you would use:

```bash
cd examples
python example1.py
```

Replace example1.py with the name of the script you want to run.

Note: In case of helloworld.py, you'd need to pass the path to the file you want to play in the argument like this:

```bash
python helloworld.py ../assets/video.mp4
```

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, make sure you have the latest versions of Python and GStreamer installed. If the problem persists, please open an issue on GitHub.
